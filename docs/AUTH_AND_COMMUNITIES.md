# Accounts, ownership, and communities

## Product model

- **My book**: Google-signed-in users co-own portfolios via `portfell_portfolio_owners` (many users ↔ many portfolios). Full live read **and** write for every co-owner.
- `portfell_portfolios.owner_id` remains as optional primary/creator hint; **authorization uses the junction table**.
- **Communities**: members see each co-owner’s book live, **read-only**.
- Sheet PIN/password remains an **optional extra lock** on top of co-ownership.
- Guest `/?share=TOKEN` links stay time-limited external read-only views of the creator’s co-owned book.

## Seed ownership (test circle)

| Email | Portfolios |
|-------|------------|
| `martin.aasa@upthink.ee` | Aasad, Anu, MaryAnn |
| Seed row / `UPSIDE_SEED_KARUD_EMAIL` | Karud |
| Seed row / `UPSIDE_SEED_LAP_EMAIL` | Lap |

Multiple emails can map to the **same** `portfolio_slug` in `portfell_seed_claims` for co-ownership.

Claims: `/auth/callback` + `GET /api/portfolios` via `ensureProfileAndClaims` → junction insert.

- Preferred: `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` on Vercel.
- Fallback: RPC `portfell_claim_seed_for_me()`.

Ops SQL: `scripts/seed-ownership.sql`.

Add co-owner after both users exist: `POST /api/portfolios/:id/owners` `{ "email": "…" }` (caller must already co-own).

## My Account (`/account`)

- **Community profile**: `display_name`, `bio`, `avatar_url` via `PATCH /api/auth/me` — shown on community member lists.
- **Portfolio invites**: mint shareable codes/links (`POST /api/portfolios/:id/invites`). Partner accepts at `/account/join?code=…` (`POST /api/portfolios/join`). Optional email locks the invite; if they already have a profile, Account tries direct co-owner add first.

## Migrations

- `008` profiles + ownership + communities + RLS  
- `009` share links `created_by`  
- `010` claim RPC (superseded claim body in `011`)  
- `011` `portfell_portfolio_owners` + co-owner RLS  
- `012` profile `bio` + `portfell_portfolio_invites`  

## PIN notes

Writes require a signed-in **co-owner**, then optional sheet PIN.
